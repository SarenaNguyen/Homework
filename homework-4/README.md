# Homework-4

Homework 4 has two components to be submitted:


1. A written document where you complete some derivations and describe your semester-long project. This will be submitted via Canvas.

1. A short coding example where you calculate reaction rates for chemical and electrochemical reactions. This will be submitted via GitHub (more, below).

## 1. Written Assignment
You will submit a written report (as a typed pdf) to answer the following questions/derivations:

### 1.1 Relating thermodynamics and Kinetics
In class, we discussed that there are two approaches the determining the equilibrium state for a chemical reaction - chemical kinetic equilibrim and thermodynamic equilibrium.  The kinetic equilibrium is found by setting the rate of progress equal to zero, while the thermodynamic condition is found by setting the Gibbs energy of reaction to zero. 

Obviously, the two approaches must produce the same result, and are linked to one another by the fact that both equations involve the product of species activities, raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

Derive an expression that relates the ratio of the forward and reverse kinetic rate constants: `(k_fwd/k_rev)` to the standard-state Gibbs energy of reaction `dG^o_rxn`.


### 1.2 Relating mass action kinetics and the Bulter-Volmer Form

### 1.3 Semester-long project Identification

## 2. Coding Assignment
You will complete the Jupyter notebook template to calculate current density as a function
